This is a basic Windows Form application that can be used by a legal consultant to create and archive documents and link relevant PDF files.

NOTE: This is a very rough application that is full of bugs and bad practice. I used it as a project to teach myself C# and how to make windows form applications. In it's current state, it should only be used as a reference and not as a final product. If you chose to use this code, please do so with an understanding that there will be many bugs!
